	description "The Sentry Drone is little more than a joke among those in the Corporation design team. Nothing more than a huge metal box filled with targetting computer and a single turret hardpoint placed on the top, the Sentry is a rarely seen drone that can be very useful in numbers, but due to its large mass and low engine capacity it is a rather easy target to hit and does not last long in large battles."
